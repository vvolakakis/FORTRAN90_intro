# FORTRAN90_intro
A very simple and basic intro in FORTRAN 90, going through the setup of your operating system, getting to know the basics of FORTRAN 90, up to coding your way through a few simple examples and functions. Included are the steps of preparing your OS, finding your preferred compiler, installing the necessary modules, some basic introduction in the "grammar" of FORTRAN 90, and listed are some files with examples and simple functions which will enables us to take our first steps.

In the development of the above tutorials and codes presented here, all programming solutions were obtained from publicly available tutorials and resources related to FORTRAN 90. The author of this repository acknowledges that the tutorial guidances, steps, and coding examples are an adaptation of examples and guidance found on (1), (2) and (3). No proprietary or personally developed code is included in this work. Full credit is given to the original authors and contributors of the referenced code, and their contributions are duly acknowledged throughout the manuscript.
